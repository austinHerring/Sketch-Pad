# Sketch-Pad
This project that was inspired from a homework assignment teaching JavaFX in the course, "Intro to Object-Oriented Programming." I had a lot of fun programming it and sometimes when I'm bored I'll doodle on it!  The Circle and Square tool are slighty buggy however. Maybe I'll get around to fixing it when I have time.
